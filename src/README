## main.cpp
1. Two state machines are used for debouncing the switch and for
implementing the display of the 8x8 LED smiley or frowny face.

2. If the accelerometer movement reaches a defined threshold value, a
piezo alarm will trigger and produce a chirping sound. Your group will
determine the threshold value to trigger the piezo through
experimentation.

3. Once the piezo alarm is triggered it will remain on until it is
silenced by pressing a button switch.

4. The x,y and z data from the accelerometer will be read out in the
while loop in main()
- Read the datasheet and obtain necessary register numbers (hex)
- Initialize I2C process
- sei() <- make sure this is in there so that Serial.println works
- Start the I2C transmission to the SLA
- Write to power management -> write wakeup command (all zeros)
- Inside the while(1)
• Read from X high register -> Read from X low register
• Read from Y high register -> Read from Y low register
• Read from Z high register -> Read from Z low register
• Combine registers and serial print information
• Stop the I2C trans
