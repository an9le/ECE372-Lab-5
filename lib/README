# Lab 5 Libraries

Each one of the folders adjacent to this `README.md` designate a library for for controlling different components of the system.

   You will need to create a circuit using your breadboard, jumper wires,
accelerometer, 8x8 led matrix, piezo speaker and a push button switch.
There should be no special function registers used in the code for
main(). Arduino libraries for Serial.println can be used for printing
x,y, and z accelerometer data and also debugging. You will need to
build your own timer function for delays when needed.

   Read the MPU 6050 accelerometer datasheets. You will use the WHO_AM_I
register (pg. 46 of register map) as the SLA. The register that you
will be reading from are the ACCEL_nOUT registers (pg. 30 of register
map). There are two 8-bit registers for X, Y, and Z. These registers
will need to be read and combined to gather the necessary information.
Finally, you need to obtain the power management register information
(pg. 41 of register map). Before developing your threshold values, you
should verify that data changes in all orthogonal x,y and z directions.

   You will need to determine your accelerometer threshold tilt value
(approximately 45degrees from rest position) based on actual readings
that you obtain.

   Read the 8x8 LED Matrix display datasheet (MAX7221 on how to interface
the LED matrix using SPI protocol.

   Use the passive piezo buzzer device. The alarm sound should be a
chirping sound.
